title: "Bonds: Lending Your Money for Returns"
topic: "asset-classes"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "6 min"
order: 3
prerequisites:
  - "what-are-asset-classes"
keyTakeaways:
  - "When you buy a bond, you're LENDING money — to a company or the government. They promise to pay you fixed interest (coupon) and return your principal on a set date. You're the lender, not the owner."
  - "Government bonds (G-Secs) are the safest investment in India — literally backed by the Government of India's ability to collect taxes. They're how the government borrows money from citizens."
  - "Bond prices move OPPOSITE to interest rates. When RBI raises rates, existing bond prices fall. When RBI cuts rates, existing bond prices rise. This inverse relationship is the most important concept in fixed-income investing."
quiz:
  - question: "You buy a Government of India bond with 7% coupon for ₹1,000 (face value). Next year, RBI raises interest rates and new bonds offer 8%. What happens to YOUR bond?"
    options:
      - "Nothing — you still get 7% forever"
      - "Your coupon increases to 8% automatically"
      - "Your bond's market price drops below ₹1,000 (because new buyers prefer 8% bonds), but you still receive 7% coupon"
      - "The government compensates you for the difference"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Your 7% coupon is FIXED — it doesn't change. But if new bonds offer 8%, nobody will pay ₹1,000 for your 7% bond when they can buy an 8% bond for the same price. Your bond's market price drops to ~₹875 to make the effective yield 8% for new buyers. However, if you HOLD to maturity, you still get your full ₹1,000 back + all coupon payments. The price drop only matters if you sell early."
  - question: "Which is safer — a corporate bond from Tata or a Government of India bond?"
    options:
      - "Tata corporate bond — Tata is a more trusted brand"
      - "Government bond — the government can print money and collect taxes, a company can't"
      - "Both are equally safe"
      - "Depends on the interest rate"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Government bonds are backed by the sovereign guarantee of India — the government can always collect taxes or (in extreme cases) print money to pay its debts. A corporate bond, even from Tata, carries credit risk — the company COULD default (extremely unlikely for Tata, but possible for smaller companies). This is why government bonds pay lower interest than corporate bonds — lower risk = lower reward."

In the last article, you learned that stocks make you an OWNER. Bonds are the opposite: **they make you a LENDER.**

When you buy a bond, you're lending money to someone — the Government of India, a company like Reliance, or a bank like SBI. In return, they promise to pay you regular interest (called <JargonTooltip term="Coupon" definition="The fixed interest payment a bond pays periodically (usually semi-annually). A 7% coupon on a ₹1,000 bond means ₹70/year.">coupon</JargonTooltip>) and return your money on a fixed date (called <JargonTooltip term="Maturity" definition="The date when the bond issuer returns the original investment (face value) to the bondholder.">maturity</JargonTooltip>).

<Analogy>
  Think of bonds like Fixed Deposits — but instead of lending to your bank,
  you're lending directly to the government or a company. The interest rate is
  fixed at the start. You know exactly when you'll get your money back. The
  difference? Bonds can be bought and sold on the market (like stocks), while
  FDs are stuck with your bank until maturity.
</Analogy>

## How Bonds Work — A Simple Example

You buy a Government of India bond worth ₹1,000 (face value) with a 7.2% annual coupon and 10-year maturity.

<ComparisonTable
  title="Your Bond Cash Flows"
  headers={["Year", "What You Receive", "Amount"]}
  rows={[
    ["Year 0", "You PAY the face value", "-₹1,000"],
    ["Year 1-10", "Annual coupon (7.2%)", "+₹72/year"],
    ["Year 10", "Face value returned", "+₹1,000"],
    ["Total received", "₹720 interest + ₹1,000 principal", "+₹1,720"],
  ]}
/>

**Your total return: ₹720 in interest on a ₹1,000 investment over 10 years.** Predictable. Boring. And that's exactly the point — bonds provide stability, not excitement.

<IndianContext>
  Individual investors can now buy Government of India bonds directly through
  **RBI Retail Direct** — a free online account that lets you participate in
  G-Sec auctions. Minimum investment starts at ₹10,000. You can also buy
  Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs), Treasury Bills (T-Bills), and State Development
  Loans through this platform. It's one of the safest investments available,
  literally backed by the Government of India.

## The Big Concept: Why Bond Prices Move Opposite to Interest Rates

This is the #1 concept in bond investing, and most beginners get confused by it:

<KeyConcept title="The Price-Yield Seesaw">
  Imagine you own a 7% bond. RBI raises rates to 8%. Now new bonds pay 8%. Who
  wants YOUR old 7% bond? Nobody — unless you sell it at a DISCOUNT. Your bond's
  price drops from ₹1,000 to ~₹875. Conversely, if RBI CUTS rates to 6%, your 7%
  bond becomes premium — its price rises above ₹1,000 because it pays more than
  new bonds.

<CaseStudy title="How Deepa Used Bonds During a Market Crash">
  **Deepa**, 35, a freelance designer in Mumbai, had ₹12,00,000 invested: 70% equity (₹8,40,000), 30% in a gilt mutual fund (₹3,60,000 — invests in government bonds).

**March 2020:** COVID crash hit. Her equity dropped 35% → ₹5,46,000. But her gilt fund ROSE 8% → ₹3,89,000. Why? Because RBI slashed interest rates from 5.15% to 4% to stimulate the economy — and bond prices rise when rates fall.

**Her total portfolio:** ₹5,46,000 + ₹3,89,000 = ₹9,35,000 (down 22%, not 35%)

While pure equity investors lost 35%, Deepa's bond allocation cushioned the blow by ₹1,60,000. This is why bonds exist in a portfolio — not for high returns, but to soften crashes and provide stability.
