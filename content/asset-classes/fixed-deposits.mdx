topic: "asset-classes"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "5 min"
order: 8
prerequisites:
  - "bonds-explained"
keyTakeaways:
  - "FDs feel safe but are 'silently losing' money — at 6.5% FD return, 30% tax bracket, and 6% inflation, your REAL after-tax return is just 0.55%. You're barely treading water."
  - "Government securities (G-Secs, T-Bills, SGBs) through RBI Retail Direct are safer than bank FDs, often offer better returns, and are sovereign-guaranteed — yet most Indians don't know they exist."
  - "FDs have a role for money you need within 1-3 years. For anything longer, there are better options (debt mutual funds, SGBs, PPF) that give higher returns with similar or better safety."
quiz:
  - question: "You put ₹5,00,000 in a 7% FD. You're in the 30% tax bracket. Inflation is 6%. What's your REAL return?"
    options:
      - "7%"
      - "4.9% (after 30% tax)"
      - "0.9% (after tax AND inflation)"
      - "-1.1% (you're actually losing money)"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "After-tax return: 7% × (1 - 0.30) = 4.9%. Real return after inflation: 4.9% - 6% = -1.1%. Your ₹5L FD earns ₹35,000/year in interest. Tax takes ₹10,500. Inflation makes prices rise by ₹30,000. Net real gain: -₹5,500. You're going BACKWARDS. FDs in the 30% tax bracket are a losing proposition against inflation."
  - question: "Which is safer — a ₹5L FD at SBI or a ₹5L investment in Government Securities through RBI Retail Direct?"
    options:
      - "SBI FD — SBI is a trusted bank"
      - "Government Security — directly backed by Government of India, no intermediary risk"
      - "Both are equally safe"
      - "Neither — only cash is truly safe"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Government Securities (G-Secs) carry the sovereign guarantee of India — the government's promise to pay. Bank FDs are protected by DICGC insurance only up to ₹5L per bank per depositor. For amounts above ₹5L, if the bank fails, you could lose money. G-Secs have zero such risk — they're THE safest financial instrument in India."

Fixed Deposits. The national investment of India. Your parents have them. Your grandparents swore by them. Bank managers love selling them.

And for most people in the 30% tax bracket, FDs are **quietly destroying wealth** while making you feel safe.

Let's understand when FDs make sense, when they don't, and what the alternatives are.

<Analogy>
  An FD is like keeping food in the refrigerator. It slows down spoilage
  (inflation erosion). But it doesn't make the food grow or multiply. If you
  keep food in the fridge for 10 years, it's still going bad — just slower. For
  short periods, the fridge is great. For long periods, you need to plant a
  garden (equity investments) that actually produces new food.
</Analogy>

## The Real Return Problem

<FormulaBox
  title="Real Return of a Fixed Deposit"
  formula="Real Return = FD Rate × (1 - Tax Rate) - Inflation Rate"
  variables={[
    {
      symbol: "FD Rate",
      meaning: "The advertised interest rate (currently 6.5-7.5%)",
    },
    {
      symbol: "Tax Rate",
      meaning: "Your income tax slab (0%, 5%, 20%, or 30%)",
    },
    {
      symbol: "Inflation Rate",
      meaning: "CPI inflation (average 5-6% in India)",
    },
  ]}

    "Real Return (After Inflation)",
    "Verdict",
  ]}
  rows={[
    ["0% (No tax)", "7.0%", "7.0%", "+1.0%", "Barely positive ✅"],
    ["5% (₹3-7L income)", "7.0%", "6.65%", "+0.65%", "Almost zero 😐"],
    ["20% (₹7-10L)", "7.0%", "5.60%", "-0.40%", "Losing money ❌"],
    ["30% (₹10L+)", "7.0%", "4.90%", "-1.10%", "Clearly losing ❌"],
  ]}
/>

<KeyConcept title="The Uncomfortable Math">
  If you're in the 30% tax bracket, every ₹1,00,000 in FDs loses **₹1,100 in
  real value every year.** Your bank statement shows ₹7,000 interest, but after
  ₹2,100 tax and ₹6,000 inflation adjustment, you have LESS purchasing power
  than you started with. The FD is a guaranteed way to slowly get poorer — while
  feeling like you're saving.
</KeyConcept>

## When FDs Actually Make Sense

FDs aren't always bad. They have specific, valid uses:

## Government Securities — The FD Upgrade Nobody Knows About

<IndianContext>
  RBI Retail Direct (launched 2021) lets you buy government securities directly
  — G-Secs, T-Bills, SDLs, and SGBs — with a free online account. No broker
  needed. Minimum: ₹10,000. These are sovereign-guaranteed (safer than bank FDs)
  and often offer better yields. Yet, as of 2024, fewer than 3 lakh Indians have
  opened RBI Retail Direct accounts — compared to 15 crore+ Demat accounts.

<CaseStudy title="PPF vs FD vs Debt Fund — The 15-Year Comparison">
  Three friends — **Ravi, Meera, and Shankar** — each invested ₹1,50,000/year (₹12,500/month) for 15 years.

**Ravi chose FDs** (7%, 30% tax bracket):

- Pre-tax value: ₹39,40,000
- After annual tax on interest: ₹34,20,000
- **After inflation (real value): ~₹20,50,000**

**Meera chose PPF** (7.1%, tax-free):

- Value: ₹40,70,000 (completely tax-free — no tax on interest or maturity)
- **After inflation (real value): ~₹24,40,000**

**Shankar chose a debt mutual fund** (8%, taxed at slab when sold):

- Value: ₹43,50,000
- Tax on gains: ₹4,05,000 (at 30%)
- After-tax value: ₹39,45,000
- **After inflation (real value): ~₹23,70,000**

PPF wins for tax-free guaranteed returns. But all three pale compared to equity: ₹12,500/month in Nifty 50 for 15 years at 12% = ₹63,00,000 (₹37,80,000 real value). For money you don't need for 15 years, equity is the clear winner.
