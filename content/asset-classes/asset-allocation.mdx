readTime: "8 min"

prerequisites:
  - "what-are-asset-classes"
  - "stocks-explained"
  - "bonds-explained"
  - "gold-investing"
  - "index-funds-best-friend"
keyTakeaways:
  - "Your asset allocation — how you split money between equity, debt, and gold — determines 90% of your portfolio's behaviour. Individual stock or fund selection matters far less than most people think."
  - "The simplest rule: subtract your age from 100 — that's your equity percentage. At 25, put 75% in equity. At 50, put 50%. Adjust based on your risk appetite, but this is a solid starting point."
  - "Rebalancing once a year — selling what's grown big and buying what's fallen — is the disciplined way to 'buy low, sell high' without emotion or prediction."
quiz:
  - question: "Which has more impact on your long-term portfolio returns?"
    options:
      - "Picking the right stocks or mutual funds"
      - "Asset allocation — how you divide money between equity, debt, and gold"
      - "Timing the market — buying at the right time"
      - "Using the best broker platform"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Academic research (Brinson, Hood & Beebower study) found that asset allocation explains ~90% of portfolio return variation. Whether you pick Fund A or Fund B within equity matters far less than whether you're 70% equity or 30% equity. Get the big picture right first — details matter second."
  - question: "You're 30 years old. Your portfolio is 60% equity, 25% debt, 15% gold. After a bull market, equity is now 75% of your portfolio. What should you do?"
    options:
      - "Nothing — let the winners ride"
      - "Sell some equity, buy debt and gold to bring back to 60/25/15 — this is called rebalancing"
      - "Move everything to equity since it's doing well"
      - "Switch to all cash until market corrects"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Rebalancing forces you to sell some equity (which has grown 'expensive') and buy debt/gold (which are relatively 'cheap'). This is systematic 'buy low, sell high' without emotion. It also maintains your target risk level — 75% equity is significantly riskier than 60% equity. Rebalance once a year or when allocation drifts more than 5% from target."
  - question: "Two investors start with ₹10L each for 15 years. Investor A picks the best stocks but has no asset allocation plan. Investor B uses a simple 70/20/10 allocation with index funds. Who likely performs better?"
    options:
      - "Investor A — great stock picks always win"
      - "Investor B — disciplined allocation beats brilliant but chaotic picking over time"
      - "They'll be about the same"
      - "Can't determine without knowing which stocks"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Studies consistently show that disciplined asset allocation with regular rebalancing outperforms random stock picking for 80%+ of investors. Investor A's 'great picks' might include emotional sells during crashes, excessive concentration, and inconsistent behaviour. Investor B's systematic approach captures market returns, maintains balance, and minimises costly emotional decisions."

You now know the building blocks: stocks, bonds, gold, real estate, FDs. Each serves a purpose. But knowing the ingredients isn't enough — you need the RECIPE.

**Asset allocation is the recipe.** It's the single most important investment decision you'll make — more important than which stock you pick, which mutual fund you choose, or when you invest.

<Analogy>
  Think of building a cricket team. You need batsmen (equity — scoring
  runs/growing wealth), bowlers (bonds — defending/stability), fielders (gold —
  saving catches/crisis protection), and a wicketkeeper (cash — always ready for
  surprises). A team of only batsmen scores well but can't defend. A team of
  only bowlers defends but can't score. The RIGHT MIX wins matches — and the
  right asset allocation wins your financial game.
</Analogy>

## The 90/10 Rule of Investing

<KeyConcept title="Asset Allocation Explains 90% of Returns">
  A landmark study by Brinson, Hood & Beebower found that **asset allocation
  explains approximately 90% of portfolio return variability.** The remaining
  10% comes from stock selection, market timing, and other factors. Translation:
  whether you're 70% equity or 30% equity matters FAR more than which specific
  equity fund you pick. Get the big decision right first.

<IndianContext>
  The "100 minus age" rule is a simple starting point. At 25, you'd put 75% in
  equity. At 60, you'd put 40% in equity. But this is a STARTING POINT, not a
  commandment. Adjust based on: your actual risk tolerance (can you sleep if
  your portfolio drops 40%?), your income stability (government job = can take
  more equity risk; freelancer = need more cash cushion), and your specific
  goals (wedding in 2 years needs 100% debt, not equity).

## How to Rebalance — The Annual Tune-Up

<CaseStudy title="Rebalancing in Action — Sneha's Portfolio">
  **Sneha**, 30, starts with a 70/20/10 allocation on ₹10,00,000:
  - Equity: ₹7,00,000
  - Debt: ₹2,00,000
  - Gold: ₹1,00,000

**After 1 year (bull market):**

- Equity grew 20%: ₹8,40,000
- Debt grew 7%: ₹2,14,000
- Gold grew 5%: ₹1,05,000
- **Total: ₹11,59,000**
- Current allocation: Equity 72.5% / Debt 18.5% / Gold 9.0%

**Rebalancing action:**

- Target: 70/20/10 of ₹11,59,000 = ₹8,11,300 / ₹2,31,800 / ₹1,15,900
- Sell ₹28,700 of equity and buy ₹17,800 debt + ₹10,900 gold

**What this achieves:** Sneha systematically sold equity after it did well (selling high) and bought debt/gold which lagged (buying low). No prediction needed. No emotional decision. Just annual arithmetic.
