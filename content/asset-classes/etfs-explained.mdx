title: "ETFs: The Best of Stocks and Mutual Funds"
topic: "asset-classes"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "6 min"
order: 5
prerequisites:
  - "mutual-funds"
keyTakeaways:
  - "An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a mutual fund that trades like a stock — you buy and sell it on the stock exchange through your Zerodha/Groww app, just like buying TCS shares."
  - "ETFs typically have the LOWEST expense ratios (0.03-0.1%) because they passively track an index. Over 20 years, this fee advantage can mean ₹3-5L more in your pocket compared to regular mutual funds."
  - "For most Indian beginners, an index mutual fund is MORE practical than an ETF because of liquidity issues and the need for a Demat account. ETFs shine for larger, lump-sum investments."
quiz:
  - question: "What's the key difference between an ETF and a regular index mutual fund?"
    options:
      - "ETFs give higher returns"
      - "ETFs trade on the stock exchange in real-time like stocks; index funds are bought/sold at end-of-day NAV"
      - "ETFs are safer than index funds"
      - "ETFs don't have expense ratios"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The main difference is HOW you buy/sell. ETFs trade like stocks — you see live prices and can buy/sell during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM). Index mutual funds process orders at end-of-day NAV. Both track the same index and give nearly identical returns. The choice is about convenience, not performance."
  - question: "The Nifty 50 ETF is trading at ₹240 on the exchange, but the actual NAV (based on underlying stocks) is ₹242. What's happening?"
    options:
      - "The ETF is overvalued"
      - "The ETF is trading at a discount — the market price is below the actual value of the holdings"
      - "This is normal and doesn't matter"
      - "The exchange made an error"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "This ₹2 difference (0.83% discount) means you're buying ₹242 worth of stocks for ₹240 — a slight bargain. This happens due to supply/demand on the exchange. However, for low-volume ETFs, this discount/premium can be larger (2-5%), which is a real risk. For high-volume ETFs like Nifty BeES, the gap is usually negligible (0.01-0.1%)."

You now know stocks and mutual funds. ETFs are the bridge between them — the convenience of stock trading, the diversification of a mutual fund, and the lowest fees in the market.

But are they right for YOU? That depends on a few practical details most articles skip.

<Analogy>
  If a mutual fund is like ordering food via Swiggy (someone packages it for you
  and delivers at a fixed time), an ETF is like buying from the buffet counter
  yourself (you pick what you want, at live prices, in real time). Same food
  quality, different buying experience. Some people prefer delivery convenience;
  others want the control of picking from the counter.

<KeyConcept title="The Practical Verdict for Indian Investors">
  Most Indian ETFs (except Nifty BeES and a few others) have LOW trading
  volumes, which creates **tracking error** and **price premiums/discounts**.
  For most beginners, a **Nifty 50 index mutual fund** (Direct plan, 0.1-0.2%
  expense ratio) is simpler, supports SIP, and has no liquidity issues. Switch
  to ETFs when your portfolio crosses ₹10L+ and you want to optimise fees
  further.
</KeyConcept>

<IndianContext>
  India's ETF market is growing but still small compared to the US. The largest
  Indian ETF is SBI Nifty 50 ETF with ~₹1.7 lakh crore in assets. However, many
  sector and thematic ETFs have volumes of only 1,000-5,000 units/day — trying
  to buy/sell ₹5L worth could move the price against you. Stick to the top 5-10
  ETFs by volume: Nifty BeES (Nippon), SBI Nifty 50 ETF, CPSE ETF, and Bharat 22
  ETF.

<CaseStudy title="When ETFs Make Sense — And When They Don't">
  **Scenario 1 — Meera (SIP investor, ₹15,000/month):** Meera invests via monthly SIP. An ETF would require her to manually buy every month, pay brokerage each time (~₹20), and deal with variable prices. **Better choice: Index mutual fund** (auto-SIP, no brokerage, end-of-day NAV).

**Scenario 2 — Vikram (lump sum, ₹10,00,000):** Vikram has ₹10L to invest from a bonus. Buying Nifty BeES ETF at 0.04% expense vs a Nifty 50 index fund at 0.18% saves him 0.14% annually. On ₹10L over 10 years, that's about **₹22,000 in savings**. Not life-changing, but meaningful. One-time brokerage of ₹20. **Better choice: ETF** (lower cost, no SIP needed).
