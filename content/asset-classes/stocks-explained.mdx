title: "Stocks: Owning a Piece of a Company"
topic: "asset-classes"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "7 min"
order: 2
prerequisites:
  - "what-are-asset-classes"
keyTakeaways:
  - "When you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of a REAL business — not a ticker symbol on a screen. Treat every stock purchase as buying into a company you believe in for 5+ years."
  - "Stocks are classified by size (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap) and sector (IT, banking, pharma). Understanding this classification helps you diversify properly."
  - "For beginners, individual stock picking is harder than it looks — 80%+ of active stock pickers underperform index funds over 10 years, even professionals."
quiz:
  - question: "What determines whether a company is 'large-cap', 'mid-cap', or 'small-cap'?"
    options:
      - "The price of one share"
      - "Market capitalization (share price × total number of shares)"
      - "The company's annual revenue"
      - "How old the company is"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Market cap = share price × total shares outstanding. Reliance at ₹2,800/share with 676 crore shares = ₹18.9 lakh crore market cap (large-cap). A ₹2,800 share price alone tells you nothing — a company could have very few shares at a high price or billions of shares at a low price. Market cap is what matters."
  - question: "You invest ₹50,000 in Infosys stock. The company pays a ₹30/share dividend and your shares are worth ₹52,000 after 1 year. What's your total return?"
    options:
      - "4% (₹2,000 capital gain only)"
      - "The return depends on dividends + capital gain combined"
      - "6% (₹2,000 gain + ₹1,000 dividend assuming ~33 shares)"
      - "Can't calculate without more information"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Your total return has two components: capital appreciation (₹52,000 - ₹50,000 = ₹2,000) + dividends received (₹30 × ~33 shares = ₹990). Total return ≈ ₹2,990 on ₹50,000 = ~6%. Many investors forget to count dividends — for mature companies like ITC or Coal India, dividends can be 3-5% of your return each year."
  - question: "Which statement about stock investing is TRUE?"
    options:
      - "You need ₹1 lakh minimum to start buying stocks"
      - "You can buy even 1 share of any listed company (some cost under ₹100)"
      - "Stocks are only for people who can watch the market daily"
      - "You must sell stocks within 1 year to avoid penalties"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "There is no minimum investment in stocks — you can buy 1 share of YES Bank for ~₹20 or 1 share of ITC for ~₹450. You don't need to watch markets daily (long-term investors check monthly or quarterly). And there's no penalty for holding stocks — in fact, longer holding periods (1 year+) get LOWER tax rates (12.5% LTCG vs 20% STCG)."

"I bought Reliance at ₹2,000. It went to ₹2,800. I made 40%!"

You've heard stories like this. But have you ever asked: **what did you actually buy?** Not a ticker symbol. Not a moving green line on a chart. You bought a piece of Mukesh Ambani's empire — every Jio tower, every Reliance Retail store, every refinery.

When you really understand what stock ownership means, you stop gambling and start investing.

<Analogy>
  Buying a stock is like buying a flat in a massive apartment complex. You own
  one flat (share) in a building that has millions of flats. You benefit when
  the builder adds amenities (company grows). You receive your share of rent
  collected from commercial spaces (dividends). The value of your flat rises
  when the neighbourhood improves (stock price appreciation). You don't run the
  building (the management team does), but you're an owner with real rights.

<IndianContext>
  SEBI classifies the top 100 companies by market cap as large-cap, 101-250 as
  mid-cap, and 251+ as small-cap. This classification matters because mutual
  funds are required to invest according to their category — a large-cap fund
  MUST invest 80%+ in top-100 companies. For beginners, Nifty 50 (top 50
  large-caps) is the ideal starting point.
</IndianContext>

<KeyConcept title="The Size-Return Trade-off">
  Historically in India: Large-caps gave ~12-13% CAGR, mid-caps ~14-16%,
  small-caps ~16-20% — but small-caps also dropped 50-70% during crashes while
  large-caps dropped 30-40%. Higher return = higher stomach required. Start with
  large-caps, add mid-caps later, and only touch small-caps with money you can
  afford to lose 50% of temporarily.
</KeyConcept>

## How Stocks Make You Money

Stocks generate returns through TWO channels:

### Channel 1: Capital Appreciation

You buy at ₹1,000, the company grows, the stock reaches ₹1,500. Your profit: ₹500 per share (50% gain). This is the main way equity builds wealth.

### Channel 2: Dividends

Some companies share their profits with shareholders as cash payments. When ITC pays ₹13.75/share dividend and you own 200 shares, you receive ₹2,750 directly in your bank account.

<CaseStudy title="The IT Employee Who Only Bought IT Stocks">
  **Karthik**, 30, a software engineer at Infosys in Bangalore. He "knew" the IT sector well, so he invested ₹5,00,000 in IT stocks: Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL Tech.

**2021-2022:** IT sector boomed. His portfolio hit ₹8,00,000. He felt like a genius.

**2022-2023:** US tech layoffs, reduced IT spending. Nifty IT index dropped 25%. His portfolio fell to ₹5,50,000.

**Meanwhile,** Banking stocks rose 35% and Auto stocks rose 40% in the same period. Had Karthik diversified across sectors (not just IT), his overall portfolio would have been ₹7,20,000 instead of ₹5,50,000.

**Lesson:** Concentration in one sector — even one you "know well" — means you ride the highs AND the lows of that single sector. And your job ALREADY depends on IT — if IT slows down, you could face layoffs AND portfolio losses at the same time. That's double risk.

## Taxes on Stocks — What You Keep Matters More Than What You Earn

<KeyConcept title="The Tax Advantage of Patience">
  If you hold stocks for over 1 year, you pay only 12.5% tax on gains above
  ₹1.25L — and the first ₹1.25L is completely TAX FREE. Compare this to FD
  interest which is taxed at your full slab rate (up to 30%). This makes equity
  one of the most tax-efficient investments in India.
