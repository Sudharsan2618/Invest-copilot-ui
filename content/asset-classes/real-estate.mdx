title: "Real Estate Investing Basics"
topic: "asset-classes"
difficulty: "intermediate"
readTime: "7 min"
order: 7
prerequisites:
  - "what-are-asset-classes"
keyTakeaways:
  - "When you include home loan interest, property tax, maintenance, registration fees, and insurance — real estate returns in most Indian cities are 2-4% annually, not the '10-15%' people claim."
  - "The biggest myth: 'property always goes up.' Indian real estate was FLAT or declining in most cities from 2014-2021. Many investors who bought at 2013 peaks still haven't broken even after adjusting for inflation."
  - "For most young investors, REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) give real estate exposure starting at ₹300 — without the ₹50L+ commitment, zero maintenance headaches, and full liquidity."
quiz:
  - question: "You buy a flat for ₹50L in 2014. In 2024 it's worth ₹70L. Your 'profit' is ₹20L, right?"
    options:
      - "Yes — ₹20L profit, 40% return"
      - "No — after stamp duty (₹3.5L), registration (₹50K), interior (₹5L), maintenance (₹6L), property tax (₹1.5L), insurance (₹50K), and home loan interest (₹30L+), you actually LOST money"
      - "It depends on the location"
      - "You also earned rental income"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "On paper it's ₹20L profit. But total costs: stamp duty ₹3.5L + registration ₹50K + interior ₹5L + 10 years maintenance ₹6L + property tax ₹1.5L + home loan interest (if 80% financed at 8.5%) ₹30L+ = ₹46.5L+ in costs. Your ₹50L flat cost you ₹96.5L total by 2024, and it's worth ₹70L. You're actually ₹26.5L in the negative. Most people never calculate the TRUE cost."
  - question: "What is a REIT?"
    options:
      - "A way to buy property online"
      - "A company that owns income-generating real estate (malls, offices) and distributes 90% of rental income as dividends to investors"
      - "A real estate insurance product"
      - "A government scheme for affordable housing"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) own commercial real estate like IT parks, malls, and office buildings. They must distribute 90%+ of rental income to investors as dividends. You buy REIT units on the stock exchange starting at ~₹300 — getting real estate exposure without buying a ₹50L property. Current Indian REITs: Embassy, Mindspace, Brookfield."

"Buy land. They're not making any more of it." — Every Indian uncle ever.

This advice was golden in the 1990s when India was urbanising rapidly and property prices doubled every 5-7 years. But in 2025? Let's look at what the numbers actually say.

<Analogy>
  Buying property is like buying a restaurant. It's not just the purchase price
  — there's rent on the building (EMI/interest), maintenance, staff (property
  tax), repairs, and insurance. If the revenue (rent or resale) doesn't cover
  ALL these costs, you're running a loss-making business. Most property buyers
  in India look at the "purchase price → resale price" and think they've
  profited — ignoring the massive running costs in between.
</Analogy>

## The True Cost of Property — What Nobody Tells You

<KeyConcept title="The Math That Changes Everything">
  A ₹75L apartment actually costs you **₹1.5-1.6 crore** over 20 years when you
  include all expenses. For the property to be a "good investment," it needs to
  be worth MORE than ₹1.6 crore after 20 years. At just 3.4% annual appreciation
  (many Indian cities), it'll be worth only ₹1.46 crore — meaning you LOST money
  in real terms despite the price "going up."
</KeyConcept>

## India's Real Estate Reality Check

<IndianContext>
  From 2014 to 2020, property prices in most Indian metro cities (Mumbai,
  Delhi-NCR, Chennai, Pune) were FLAT or declining in real terms. A NoBroker
  study showed that average apartment prices in Bangalore appreciated just 2-4%
  annually during this period — barely matching inflation. Meanwhile, the Nifty
  50 delivered 11-12% CAGR. The myth that "property always goes up" was
  shattered for an entire generation of buyers. Some developments saw prices
  DROP 20-30% from their 2013 peaks.

## REITs: Real Estate Without the Headaches

For most young investors, REITs are the smarter way to access real estate:

<CaseStudy title="Renting + Investing vs Buying: The 20-Year Comparison">
  **Arjun** buys a 2BHK in Bangalore for ₹80L (₹16L down + ₹64L home loan at 8.5%, 20-year EMI: ₹55,500/month).

**Sneha** rents a similar 2BHK for ₹25,000/month and invests the difference (₹30,500/month) in a 70/30 equity-debt portfolio.

**After 20 years:**

- **Arjun's apartment:** Worth ~₹1.45 crore (3% appreciation). Total paid: ₹1.33 crore (EMIs) + ₹16L (down payment) + ₹15L (maintenance, tax, repairs) = ₹1.64 crore. **Net: -₹19L loss** (paid more than it's worth). But he owns a home — non-financial value.
- **Sneha's investments:** ₹30,500/month at 10% for 20 years = **₹2.35 crore.** Rent paid: ₹60L (₹25K × 240 months, assuming increases). **Net: ₹1.75 crore gain** + she has full liquidity.

**The financial difference: ₹1.94 crore in Sneha's favour.** But Arjun has a home — which has emotional and social value beyond money. The point isn't "never buy property" — it's "don't buy property thinking it's a great financial investment."
