difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "7 min"

prerequisites:
  - "stocks-explained"
  - "bonds-explained"
keyTakeaways:
  - "A mutual fund pools money from thousands of investors and invests it collectively. You contribute ₹5,000 and get the same diversification that would require ₹50,00,000 to build yourself."
  - "Mutual funds come in types — equity funds for growth, debt funds for stability, hybrid for balance. Your choice depends on your goal and timeline, not on which fund 'performed best last year.'"
  - "The expense ratio is the hidden fee that eats your returns. A 2% expense ratio on ₹10L over 20 years costs you ₹8L+ in lost returns. Always check this number."
quiz:
  - question: "You invest ₹10,000 in a mutual fund with NAV of ₹50. How many units do you own?"
    options:
      - "10,000 units"
      - "200 units"
      - "50 units"
      - "It depends on the fund manager"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Units = Investment ÷ NAV. ₹10,000 ÷ ₹50 = 200 units. The NAV (Net Asset Value) is the price per unit of the fund, calculated daily based on the total value of all holdings divided by total units. When the fund's holdings grow, NAV rises, and your 200 units become worth more."
  - question: "A fund has an expense ratio of 1.5% and returns 12% before expenses. What's YOUR actual return?"
    options:
      - "12%"
      - "10.5%"
      - "13.5%"
      - "12% — expense ratio is separate"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "The expense ratio is deducted from your returns. 12% gross return - 1.5% expense ratio = 10.5% net return to you. Over 20 years on ₹10L, this 1.5% costs you over ₹12L in lost returns. This is why low-cost index funds (0.1-0.2% expense ratio) often outperform actively managed funds (1-2% expense ratio)."
  - question: "You need money in 2 years for a car down payment. Which mutual fund type should you choose?"
    options:
      - "Small-cap equity fund — highest potential returns"
      - "Balanced/hybrid fund — mix of stocks and bonds"
      - "Short-term debt fund or ultra-short duration fund"
      - "Thematic fund — pick a sector that's doing well"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "For a 2-year goal, equity is too volatile — stocks can drop 30%+ in a year. Short-term or ultra-short debt funds give 6-7% with minimal volatility, and your money is safe. Never use equity for goals under 3-5 years."

"I want to invest in stocks, but I don't know which stocks to pick. I don't have enough money to diversify. I don't have time to research."

This is exactly the problem mutual funds solve. A mutual fund is the ultimate "I don't want to do this myself" investment.

<Analogy>
  Think of a mutual fund like a thali. Instead of ordering individual dishes
  (stocks/bonds), you get a pre-assembled plate with variety — rice, dal, sabzi,
  roti, curd, and maybe a sweet. An expert chef (fund manager) decides the
  recipe and proportions. Some thalis are heavy on protein (equity funds), some
  are balanced (hybrid funds), and some are light and simple (debt funds). You
  pick the thali that matches your appetite.

<IndianContext>
  **For most beginners, you only need 2-3 funds:**
  1. **Nifty 50 Index Fund** — your equity core (low cost, diversified, proven)
  2. **Short-term debt fund** — for goals under 5 years and portfolio stability
  3. **ELSS fund** — if you want to save tax under Section 80C (up to ₹1.5L deduction)

That's it. Don't fall into the "10 mutual funds for maximum diversification" trap — 3 good funds beat 10 overlapping ones.

## The Expense Ratio: The Fee That Quietly Eats Your Wealth

<KeyConcept title="Why 1% Matters More Than You Think">
  Fund A charges 0.2% expense ratio. Fund B charges 1.5%. Both invest in similar
  large-cap stocks. Over 20 years on ₹10,00,000: Fund A grows to ₹93L. Fund B
  grows to ₹75L. **The 1.3% fee difference costs you ₹18 lakhs.** That's not a
  fee — that's a second apartment's down payment.

## Direct vs Regular Plans — The ₹5L Difference

Every mutual fund has two plans selling the exact same portfolio:

<CaseStudy title="SIP Showdown: ₹10,000/month for 15 Years">
  **Sneha** and **Arjun** both invested ₹10,000/month for 15 years in the same equity fund — but Sneha chose the Direct plan and Arjun chose the Regular plan (through his bank).

- Fund gross return: 13% CAGR
- Direct plan expense ratio: 0.8%
- Regular plan expense ratio: 1.8%

**After 15 years (₹18L total invested):**

- Sneha (Direct): ₹51,40,000 (net 12.2% CAGR)
- Arjun (Regular): ₹45,20,000 (net 11.2% CAGR)

**Sneha earned ₹6,20,000 MORE** by simply choosing "Direct" instead of "Regular." Same fund, same market, same amount — but ₹6.2L difference because of a 1% fee gap compounding over 15 years.
