title: "How Stock Markets Actually Work"
topic: "financial-markets"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "8 min"
order: 2
prerequisites:
  - "what-is-stock-market"
keyTakeaways:
  - "Every stock trade needs a buyer AND a seller who disagree on value — when you think a stock is cheap and buy it, someone else thinks it's expensive and sells it. Both can't be right."
  - "Your buy/sell order travels through a chain: You → Broker (Zerodha/Groww) → Exchange (NSE/BSE) → Clearing Corporation (NSCCL) → Depository (CDSL/NSDL) — all in under 1 second."
  - "Settlement in India is T+1 — when you buy shares on Monday, they're officially yours on Tuesday. This is faster than most countries in the world."
quiz:
  - question: "You place an order to buy 10 shares of HDFC Bank at ₹1,600. When does the trade happen?"
    options:
      - "Immediately, as soon as you press 'Buy'"
      - "Only when someone else is willing to sell 10 shares at ₹1,600 or less"
      - "At the end of the trading day"
      - "When the exchange decides"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Every trade requires a counterparty — a seller willing to sell at your price. Your order goes into an electronic order book. If someone has a sell order at ₹1,600 or less, the trade matches instantly. If not, your order waits in the queue until a seller appears (or you cancel it)."
  - question: "What happens to your shares after you buy them?"
    options:
      - "They're stored in your broker's safe"
      - "They're stored electronically in your Demat account at CDSL or NSDL"
      - "The company sends you paper certificates"
      - "They exist only as numbers on your broker's app"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Shares are held electronically in your Demat (dematerialised) account, maintained by CDSL or NSDL — India's two depositories. Even if your broker (Zerodha, Groww) shuts down, your shares are safe because they're in YOUR Demat account, not the broker's. This is a crucial safety feature of Indian markets."
  - question: "Indian stock markets are open for trading:"
    options:
      - "24/7 like cryptocurrency"
      - "Monday to Friday, 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM (with holidays)"
      - "Monday to Saturday, 9 AM to 5 PM"
      - "Only when the market is 'green'"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "NSE and BSE are open Monday to Friday, 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM IST, excluding national holidays and declared market holidays. There's also a pre-open session (9:00-9:15 AM) where opening prices are determined. Weekend and late-night trading is not available for Indian stocks (unlike crypto or US markets)."

You open Zerodha. You search "RELIANCE." You see: ₹2,850. You tap "Buy." You enter "10 shares." You hit confirm. ₹28,500 leaves your account. Done.

But what just happened? In that 3-second transaction, seven different systems talked to each other, thousands of orders were matched, and a clearing corporation guaranteed that both you AND the seller got what you were promised.

Let's pull back the curtain.

<Analogy>
  Think of the stock market like Swiggy. You (the buyer) want biryani. A
  restaurant (the seller) has biryani. But you don't go to the restaurant
  directly. Swiggy (the exchange) matches your order, a delivery partner (the
  clearing corporation) ensures the food reaches you, and Swiggy's payment
  system ensures the restaurant gets paid. The stock market works the same way —
  with middlemen that ensure trust, speed, and fairness.
</Analogy>

## The Order Book: Where Buyers Meet Sellers

At any moment, thousands of people want to buy TCS and thousands want to sell. Their orders sit in an electronic **order book** — think of it as two queues:

<ComparisonTable
  title="TCS Order Book (Simplified Snapshot)"
  headers={["Buyers (Bids)", "Price", "Sellers (Asks)"]}
  rows={[
    ["200 shares wanted", "₹3,780", "—"],
    ["450 shares wanted", "₹3,775", "—"],
    ["300 shares wanted", "₹3,770", "—"],
    ["—", "₹3,785", "150 shares available"],
    ["—", "₹3,790", "500 shares available"],
    ["—", "₹3,800", "320 shares available"],
  ]}
/>

The **highest bid** (₹3,780) and the **lowest ask** (₹3,785) are just ₹5 apart. This gap is called the <JargonTooltip term="Bid-Ask Spread" definition="The difference between the highest price buyers will pay (bid) and the lowest price sellers will accept (ask). Smaller spread = more liquid market.">bid-ask spread</JargonTooltip>.

<KeyConcept title="How Prices Move">
  When more people want to buy than sell, buyers raise their bids → price goes
  UP. When more people want to sell than buy, sellers lower their asks → price
  goes DOWN. Every price movement you see on your Zerodha screen is the result
  of this constant negotiation between thousands of real people.
</KeyConcept>

## The Trade Lifecycle: From Your Thumb to Your Demat

Here's what happens when you tap "Buy" on your broker app:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Your Buy Order's Journey"
  headers={["Step", "What Happens", "Time"]}
  rows={[
    ["1. You → Broker", "You place order in Zerodha/Groww app", "Instant"],
    [
      "2. Broker → Exchange",
      "Broker forwards your order to NSE/BSE",
      "Milliseconds",
    ],
    [
      "3. Exchange matches",
      "Exchange finds a seller at your price from the order book",
      "Microseconds",
    ],
    [
      "4. Trade confirmation",
      "Both buyer and seller notified: trade done!",
      "Instant",
    ],
    [
      "5. Clearing",
      "NSCCL verifies both parties have money/shares",
      "Same day",
    ],
    [
      "6. Settlement (T+1)",
      "Money debited from you → credited to seller. Shares transferred to your Demat.",
      "Next business day",
    ],
  ]}
/>

<IndianContext>
  India moved to T+1 settlement in January 2023, making it one of the fastest
  settlement systems globally. The US only moved to T+1 in May 2024 — India was
  ahead by over a year. Previously, India had T+2 settlement (2 working days).
  SEBI is now exploring T+0 (same-day) settlement for select stocks.
</IndianContext>

## The Players Behind the Scenes

You interact with Zerodha. But behind that app, there's an entire ecosystem:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Who Does What in Indian Markets"
  headers={["Entity", "Role", "Real Example"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Broker",
      "Takes your order, routes it to exchange",
      "Zerodha, Groww, Upstox, Angel One",
    ],
    [
      "Exchange",
      "Matches buy/sell orders, ensures fair price",
      "NSE (National Stock Exchange), BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange)",
    ],
    [
      "Clearing Corporation",
      "Guarantees both sides honour the trade",
      "NSCCL (NSE Clearing), ICCL (BSE Clearing)",
    ],
    [
      "Depository",
      "Holds your shares electronically in your Demat account",
      "CDSL, NSDL",
    ],
    [
      "SEBI",
      "Regulates everything, protects investors",
      "Securities and Exchange Board of India",
    ],
  ]}
/>

<KeyConcept title="Why This Matters to You">
  If your broker (say, Zerodha) goes bankrupt tomorrow — **your shares are
  SAFE.** They're not held by Zerodha. They're in your personal Demat account at
  CDSL/NSDL. You'd simply transfer them to a new broker. This separation of
  broker and depository is one of the strongest investor protections in Indian
  markets.
</KeyConcept>

## Types of Orders You Can Place

Not all buy/sell orders are the same:

<ComparisonTable
  title="Order Types Explained"
  headers={["Order Type", "What It Does", "When to Use"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Market Order",
      "Buy/sell immediately at whatever the current price is",
      "When speed matters more than price — you just want in/out NOW",
    ],
    [
      "Limit Order",
      "Buy/sell only at your specified price (or better)",
      "When you want a specific price — 'I'll buy TCS only if it drops to ₹3,700'",
    ],
    [
      "Stop-Loss Order",
      "Automatically sell if price drops to a trigger level",
      "To limit losses — 'If HDFC drops below ₹1,500, sell automatically'",
    ],
  ]}
/>

For long-term investors using SIPs, you'll mostly use **market orders** — because whether you buy Nifty 50 at ₹24,100 or ₹24,150 doesn't matter over a 10-year horizon.

<CaseStudy title="What Happens During a Market Crash — Live Example">
  **March 23, 2020.** COVID lockdown announced. India's Nifty 50 had crashed 38% from its February high. Here's what the order book looked like:

- **Sellers flooding the market:** Panicked investors placing thousands of sell orders at ANY price
- **Buyers stepping back:** Very few willing to buy into the chaos
- **Bid-ask spreads widened:** From ₹1-2 normally to ₹10-50 on some stocks
- **Circuit breakers triggered:** NSE halted trading twice because prices fell too fast (limit down of 10% and 15%)

**Anyone who bought on that day and held?** Nifty 50 doubled within 18 months — from 7,610 to 18,000+. The market didn't change. The businesses didn't change. Only people's EMOTIONS changed.

This is why understanding market mechanics matters — when you know how it works, crashes become opportunities, not nightmares.
