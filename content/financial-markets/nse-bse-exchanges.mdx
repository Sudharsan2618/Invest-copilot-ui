title: "Stock Exchanges: NSE, BSE, and Beyond"
topic: "financial-markets"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "6 min"
order: 3
prerequisites:
  - "how-stock-markets-work"
keyTakeaways:
  - "India has TWO major stock exchanges — NSE (younger, tech-first, handles 93% of trading) and BSE (Asia's oldest, 1875). Most stocks are listed on BOTH."
  - "Nifty 50 (NSE's index) and Sensex (BSE's index) are NOT the market — they're summaries of 50 and 30 top companies respectively. When people say 'market crashed,' they mean these indices fell."
  - "You don't choose which exchange to trade on — your broker automatically routes your order to whichever exchange offers the best price at that moment."
quiz:
  - question: "What's the difference between Nifty 50 and Sensex?"
    options:
      - "Nifty 50 tracks 50 large companies on NSE; Sensex tracks 30 large companies on BSE"
      - "Nifty is for stocks; Sensex is for bonds"
      - "They track the exact same companies"
      - "Nifty is the real-time price; Sensex is the daily average"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "Nifty 50 is an index of 50 large companies listed on NSE. Sensex is an index of 30 large companies listed on BSE. They both aim to represent the overall market, but Nifty 50 is broader (50 vs 30 companies) and is used more widely for index funds. Most of the Sensex 30 companies are also in Nifty 50."
  - question: "You want to buy shares of TCS. It's listed on both NSE and BSE. Which exchange should you choose?"
    options:
      - "NSE — it's the bigger exchange"
      - "BSE — it's the older exchange"
      - "Either — your broker will automatically pick the one with the better price"
      - "You must choose based on your Demat account type"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Most brokers use 'smart order routing' — they automatically send your order to whichever exchange (NSE or BSE) offers the better price at that moment. You don't need to choose manually. The price difference between exchanges is usually negligible (a few paise) because of arbitrage traders."

When cricket happens in India, it's usually at Wankhede, Eden Gardens, or Chinnaswamy. Different stadiums, same game. India's stock exchanges work the same way — different venues, same stocks, same purpose.

But understanding the differences helps you make sense of the financial news you'll encounter every day.

<Analogy>
  Think of NSE and BSE like Amazon and Flipkart. Both sell many of the same
  products (stocks). Both are regulated by the same government body (SEBI, like
  consumer protection laws). Prices are nearly identical because of competition.
  You can buy from either one — the product you receive (shares in your Demat
  account) is exactly the same regardless of which platform you used.
</Analogy>

<IndianContext>
  Most Indian investors interact primarily with NSE because it has higher
  trading volumes (meaning better liquidity and tighter bid-ask spreads).
  However, BSE is important too — many companies are listed only on BSE, and
  BSE's SME platform lists smaller companies that might become tomorrow's blue
  chips. When people say "the market went up 500 points," they usually mean
  Sensex (BSE) went up 500 points, since Sensex is the older, more recognized
  index in mainstream media.

## Understanding Market Indices: Nifty 50 and Sensex

An <JargonTooltip term="Index" definition="A basket of selected stocks that represents the overall market or a segment of it. Changes in the index reflect the average performance of those stocks.">index</JargonTooltip> is like a class average. Instead of checking every student's score, you check the class average to understand overall performance. Nifty 50 is the "class average" of India's 50 biggest companies.

<KeyConcept title="What the Nifty 50 Actually Is">
  Nifty 50 picks the 50 largest and most liquid companies across sectors —
  Reliance, TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ITC, and 45 others. Each company has a
  different "weight" based on its market cap. When Reliance goes up 2%, it moves
  Nifty more than when a smaller company goes up 2%, because Reliance has a
  bigger weight.
</KeyConcept>

<ComparisonTable
  title="Top 10 Companies in Nifty 50 (Approximate Weights)"
  headers={["Company", "Sector", "Approx. Weight"]}
  rows={[
    ["Reliance Industries", "Oil, Retail, Telecom", "~10%"],
    ["HDFC Bank", "Banking", "~8%"],
    ["ICICI Bank", "Banking", "~7%"],
    ["Infosys", "IT Services", "~6%"],
    ["TCS", "IT Services", "~5%"],
    ["ITC", "FMCG, Hotels", "~4%"],
    ["Bharti Airtel", "Telecom", "~4%"],
    ["L&T", "Engineering", "~3.5%"],
    ["SBI", "Banking", "~3%"],
    ["Bajaj Finance", "NBFC", "~2.5%"],
  ]}
/>

These top 10 alone make up **~53%** of the Nifty 50's weight. So when you buy a Nifty 50 index fund, more than half your money goes into just 10 companies. That's important to understand.

<CaseStudy title="Why Index Choice Changes Your Returns">
  **Lakshmi** invested ₹10,000/month from 2014 to 2024. She chose Nifty 50. Her friend **Arjun** chose Nifty Next 50 (the next 50 largest companies after Nifty 50).

**10-year results:**

- Lakshmi (Nifty 50): ₹12,00,000 invested → ₹23,50,000 (~14% CAGR)
- Arjun (Nifty Next 50): ₹12,00,000 invested → ₹28,00,000 (~17% CAGR)

Arjun earned ₹4.5L more. But his journey was bumpier — Nifty Next 50 dropped 35% in March 2020 vs Nifty 50's 30% drop. Higher return, but you need stronger nerves.

For beginners: **start with Nifty 50.** It's the smoothest ride with excellent long-term returns.
