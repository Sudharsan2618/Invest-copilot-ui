title: "Market Benchmarks You Should Know"
topic: "index-investing"
difficulty: "intermediate"
readTime: "5 min"
order: 6
prerequisites:
  - "what-is-an-index"
  - "how-index-funds-work"
keyTakeaways:
  - "A benchmark is the yardstick you measure your investments against. If your portfolio returned 10% but Nifty 50 returned 14%, you didn't do well — you underperformed by 4%. Without a benchmark, you can't tell if you're winning or losing."
  - "Different investments need different benchmarks: compare large-cap funds to Nifty 50, mid-cap to Nifty Midcap 150, debt funds to CRISIL indices. Comparing a mid-cap fund to Nifty 50 is like comparing a sprinter to a marathon runner."
  - "TRI (Total Return Index) includes dividends reinvested, while PRI (Price Return Index) doesn't. Always use TRI for accurate comparison — Nifty 50 TRI returns are ~1-1.5% higher than PRI, which makes a big difference over 10+ years."
quiz:
  - question: "Your mutual fund returned 15% last year. Was this good performance?"
    options:
      - "Yes — 15% is a great return"
      - "It depends on what the benchmark returned. If Nifty 50 returned 20%, your fund underperformed by 5%."
      - "Yes, as long as it beats inflation"
      - "It depends on who manages the fund"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "15% sounds great in isolation. But if the benchmark (Nifty 50) returned 20%, your actively managed fund, despite charging higher fees, gave you 5% LESS. You'd have been better off in a simple index fund. Returns without benchmarks are meaningless — it's like saying 'I scored 60' without mentioning the test was out of 100 or out of 200."
  - question: "What's the difference between Nifty 50 PRI and Nifty 50 TRI?"
    options:
      - "PRI includes dividends, TRI doesn't"
      - "TRI includes dividends reinvested, PRI only tracks price changes — TRI gives a more complete picture"
      - "They're the same thing with different names"
      - "PRI is for stocks, TRI is for bonds"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Nifty 50 TRI (Total Return Index) includes dividends reinvested back into the index, while PRI (Price Return Index) only tracks stock price changes. Since Nifty 50 stocks pay ~1-1.5% in annual dividends, TRI is always higher than PRI. SEBI mandates that mutual funds use TRI as their benchmark — ensuring a fair comparison."

"My fund gave 12% return last year!"

Great. But 12% compared to WHAT? If the market gave 18%, your fund underperformed by 6%. If the market gave 5%, your fund crushed it by 7%.

**Returns without benchmarks are meaningless.** A benchmark is the measuring stick that tells you whether your investment actually performed well — or just looks good in isolation.

<Analogy>
  Imagine a student tells you they scored 75 marks. Is that good? You can't tell
  without knowing: (1) What's the maximum? (75/100 is decent; 75/500 is
  terrible), and (2) What's the class average? (75 in a class averaging 50 is
  excellent; 75 in a class averaging 90 is poor). A benchmark IS the "class
  average" for your investments. Without it, you're investing blind.

<KeyConcept title="PRI vs TRI: Why It Matters More Than You Think">
  Companies in Nifty 50 pay ~1-1.5% in annual dividends. The PRI (Price Return
  Index) ignores this — it only tracks price changes. The TRI (Total Return
  Index) includes dividends reinvested. Over 20 years at 1.3% annual dividend:
  Nifty 50 PRI = 12.0% CAGR → ₹96L on ₹10L. Nifty 50 TRI = 13.3% CAGR → ₹1.17
  crore on ₹10L. That's **₹21 lakhs** difference just from counting dividends
  properly!
</KeyConcept>

<IndianContext>
  Since 2018, SEBI mandates that all mutual funds report performance against
  **TRI benchmarks** (not PRI). Before this rule, many funds showed
  "outperformance" by comparing their returns (which included dividends) against
  PRI (which excluded dividends). After the TRI mandate, many funds that "beat
  the market" suddenly showed underperformance. Always check: is your fund
  beating the TRI benchmark?

## How to Benchmark Your Own Portfolio

<CaseStudy title="Priya's Portfolio Benchmark Reality Check">
  **Priya** has a ₹15,00,000 portfolio:
  - 60% Nifty 50 index fund (₹9,00,000)
  - 20% HDFC Mid-cap fund (₹3,00,000)
  - 10% Gold SGB (₹1,50,000)
  - 10% Short-term debt fund (₹1,50,000)

**Last year's returns:**

- Her portfolio: +13.5%
- She thinks: "Great, 13.5% is solid!"

**Benchmark check:**

- Blended benchmark: 60% × Nifty 50 TRI (15%) + 20% × Nifty Midcap 150 TRI (22%) + 10% × Gold (12%) + 10% × CRISIL Short Term (7.5%)
- Blended benchmark return: 9% + 4.4% + 1.2% + 0.75% = **15.35%**

**Reality:** Priya's portfolio UNDERPERFORMED her benchmark by 1.85%. The culprit: her HDFC Mid-cap fund returned only 16% against the Nifty Midcap 150's 22%. Her "active" mid-cap fund cost her ₹1,80,000 in potential returns.

**Action:** She might consider switching the mid-cap allocation to a Nifty Midcap 150 index fund.
