title: "The Danger of High-Interest Loans"
topic: "personal-finance"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "5 min"
order: 5
prerequisites:
  - "good-debt-vs-bad-debt"
keyTakeaways:
  - "Credit card revolving credit at 36-42% APR means a ₹50,000 balance costs you ₹1,750/month in interest alone — you're paying ₹21,000/year for the privilege of owing money."
  - "The 'minimum payment trap' is designed to keep you in debt forever — paying minimum on ₹1,00,000 takes 10+ years and costs ₹2,50,000+ in total interest."
  - "Buy-Now-Pay-Later isn't free money — miss one payment and interest rates of 24-36% kick in, turning a ₹5,000 purchase into ₹7,000+."
quiz:
  - question: "You have ₹1,00,000 credit card debt. You pay the minimum 5% (₹5,000) every month. How long until it's paid off?"
    options:
      - "20 months (₹1,00,000 ÷ ₹5,000)"
      - "About 3 years"
      - "About 7-10 years"
      - "Never — it keeps growing"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "At 40% APR, most of your ₹5,000 minimum payment goes to interest (₹3,333/month). Only ₹1,667 reduces your actual debt. It takes 7-10 years to clear, and you pay ₹2.5-3 lakhs total for a ₹1 lakh purchase. The minimum payment is designed to maximize the bank's profits, not help you."
  - question: "A salary advance app offers you ₹10,000 for 30 days with a 'processing fee' of ₹500. What's the actual annual interest rate?"
    options:
      - "5%"
      - "20%"
      - "60%"
      - "It's not interest, it's just a fee"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "₹500 fee on ₹10,000 for 30 days = 5% per month = 60% per year (APR). 'Processing fee' is interest by another name. These apps deliberately avoid showing the annual rate because 60% sounds terrifying — which it should."

There's a reason credit card companies send you pre-approved cards. There's a reason loan apps advertise on every YouTube video. There's a reason BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) is on every shopping site.

**They make enormous profits from your debt.** And the less you understand about interest rates, the more they earn.

Let's fix that.

<Analogy>
  High-interest debt is like quicksand. The deeper you sink, the harder it is to
  get out. Every month, the sand (interest) pulls you deeper. Paying the minimum
  is like gently waving your arms — it looks like you're doing something, but
  you're still sinking. The only way out is an aggressive, deliberate escape
  plan.
</Analogy>

## The True Cost of "Minimum Payment"

Banks love it when you pay the minimum. Here's why:

    "Monthly Payment",

    ["Fixed ₹20,000/month", "₹20,000", "~6 months", "₹1,08,000"],
    ["Pay in full immediately", "₹1,00,000", "0 months", "₹1,00,000"],
  ]}
/>

<KeyConcept title="The Minimum Payment Trap">
  Paying minimum on ₹1,00,000 costs you an additional **₹1,50,000+ in interest**
  over 8 years. That ₹1,00,000 purchase? It actually cost you ₹2,50,000. The
  credit card company thanks you for the ₹1,50,000 profit.

## The Hidden Cost of "Affordable" EMIs

The new trick in India is converting everything to EMIs. Phone on EMI. TV on EMI. Vacation on EMI. The EMI looks small — ₹3,000/month feels nothing. But stack them up:

<IndianContext>
  India's digital lending market has exploded — from ₹1.5 lakh crore in 2018 to
  over ₹6 lakh crore in 2024. RBI has repeatedly warned about predatory lending
  apps. Key red flags: apps that don't show APR (annual percentage rate),
  "processing fees" that are actually disguised interest, and "salary advance"
  products charging 30-60% APR. If an app won't clearly tell you the annual
  interest rate, run.

## The "Payday Loan" Problem in India

Salary advance apps (instant loan apps) are the most dangerous financial products available to young Indians:

<CaseStudy title="Rahul's Loan App Spiral">
  **Rahul**, 24, a call center employee in Noida, earned ₹22,000/month. He downloaded a salary advance app for ₹8,000 to cover an unexpected expense. Here's how the spiral happened:

- **Month 1:** Borrowed ₹8,000. "Processing fee" ₹600. Paid back ₹8,600 on salary day.
- **Month 2:** Short on cash (because he paid back ₹8,600 last month). Borrowed ₹12,000. Fee: ₹900.
- **Month 3:** Borrowed from a SECOND app to pay the first. ₹15,000. Fee: ₹1,200.
- **Month 6:** Owed ₹45,000 across four apps. Monthly "fees" of ₹3,600. That's ₹43,200/year in interest on his ₹22,000 salary — **nearly 200% APR**.

It took Rahul 8 months of living extremely frugally (and help from his family) to break free. Eight months of stress, shame, and desperate calculations — all from one ₹8,000 "convenience."
