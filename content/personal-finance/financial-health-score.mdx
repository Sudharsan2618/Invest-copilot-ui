title: "Your Financial Health Score"
topic: "personal-finance"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "6 min"
order: 6
prerequisites:
  - "income-management"
  - "emergency-funds"
keyTakeaways:
  - "Your financial health isn't just your salary or your bank balance — it's measured by 5 pillars: savings rate, emergency coverage, debt ratio, insurance coverage, and investment rate."
  - "Most young Indians score 2-3 out of 10 on financial health — not because they earn too little, but because they've never measured what matters."
  - "A ₹30,000/month earner who saves 25% is financially healthier than a ₹1,00,000/month earner who saves 5%."
quiz:
  - question: "Which financial health metric matters MOST for someone in their 20s?"
    options:
      - "Net worth (total assets minus total debts)"
      - "Savings rate (% of income saved/invested)"
      - "Salary amount"
      - "Number of investments"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "For young professionals, savings rate is the most important metric. Your net worth will be low (that's normal at 25), and salary will grow with time. But building the HABIT of saving 20-30% of income early creates compounding effects that nothing else can match. A 25-year-old saving 25% will be wealthier at 40 than a 30-year-old saving 15% even if the latter earns more."
  - question: "Priya earns ₹70,000/month and saves ₹3,000. Arjun earns ₹35,000/month and saves ₹10,000. Who is financially healthier?"
    options:
      - "Priya — she earns more"
      - "Arjun — he saves a higher percentage"
      - "They're equal — different situations"
      - "Can't tell without more information"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Arjun saves 28.6% of his income vs Priya's 4.3%. Despite earning half as much, Arjun will accumulate more wealth over time. Priya has a spending problem disguised as a high salary. Financial health is about what you KEEP, not what you EARN."

Quick question: if you went to a doctor and they said "you're healthy" without checking your blood pressure, heart rate, or any tests — would you trust them?

Of course not. Health needs measurement. Yet most people declare themselves "financially fine" without measuring a single thing. They check their bank balance, see some money, and assume all is well.

Your bank balance is like your body temperature — it tells you SOMETHING, but it definitely doesn't tell you EVERYTHING.

<Analogy>
  Your financial health is like a body checkup. Just as a doctor checks blood
  pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, heart rate, and BMI to give you a complete
  picture — your financial health needs multiple checkpoints too. A person can
  look fit on the outside but have dangerously high cholesterol. Similarly,
  someone can have a high salary but be one emergency away from financial
  crisis.

## The 5 Pillars of Financial Health

<ComparisonTable
  title="Your Financial Health Scorecard"
  headers={["Pillar", "Healthy ✅", "Warning ⚠️", "Critical 🚨"]}
  rows={[
    ["Savings Rate", "20%+ of in-hand", "10-20%", "Below 10%"],
    ["Emergency Fund", "6+ months expenses", "3-6 months", "Below 3 months"],
    ["Debt-to-Income Ratio", "Below 20% of income", "20-40%", "Above 40%"],

<KeyConcept title="Your Score, Honestly">
  Count how many pillars you're in the "Healthy" zone. 4-5 = Excellent financial
  health. 2-3 = Work in progress. 0-1 = Financial emergency. Most young
  professionals score 0-2. That's not a judgment — it's a starting point.
</KeyConcept>

## Let's Calculate Your Numbers

### Pillar 1: Savings Rate

<FormulaBox
  title="Savings Rate Formula"
  formula="Savings Rate = (Amount Saved + Invested) ÷ In-Hand Salary × 100"
  variables={[
    {
      symbol: "Amount Saved",
      meaning: "Money moved to savings account + investments each month",
    },
    {
      symbol: "In-Hand Salary",
      meaning: "Your monthly take-home pay after tax and PF",
    },
  ]}
/>

If you earn ₹50,000 in-hand and save/invest ₹12,000, your savings rate is 24%. That's healthy.

### Pillar 2: Emergency Coverage

<FormulaBox
  title="Emergency Coverage Ratio"
  formula="Emergency Coverage = Emergency Fund Balance ÷ Monthly Expenses"
  variables={[
    {
      symbol: "Emergency Fund",
      meaning:
        "Cash in savings account + liquid funds earmarked for emergencies",
    },
    {
      symbol: "Monthly Expenses",
      meaning: "Your actual monthly spending (rent + food + bills + transport)",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Pillar 3: Debt-to-Income Ratio

<FormulaBox
  title="Debt-to-Income Ratio"
  formula="DTI = Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Monthly In-Hand Income × 100"
  variables={[
    {
      symbol: "Total Debt Payments",
      meaning: "All EMIs + credit card payments + loan repayments",
    },
    { symbol: "Monthly Income", meaning: "Net salary after tax" },
  ]}
/>

<IndianContext>
  RBI guidelines suggest banks should not lend to individuals whose total EMIs
  exceed 50% of their net income. But just because a bank will lend to you at
  40% DTI doesn't mean you should borrow that much. Financial advisors recommend
  keeping DTI below 20% for comfortable living and strong savings capacity.
</IndianContext>

<CaseStudy title="Two Colleagues, Very Different Health">
  **Vikram** and **Deepa** both work at the same company and earn ₹60,000/month.

**Vikram's Scorecard:**

- Savings rate: 5% (₹3,000/month) — 🚨
- Emergency fund: ₹20,000 (0.5 months) — 🚨
- DTI: 35% (car EMI + personal loan + credit card) — 🚨
- Insurance: None — 🚨
- Investments: ₹0 — 🚨
- **Score: 0/5 — Financial Crisis Zone**

**Deepa's Scorecard:**

- Savings rate: 30% (₹18,000/month) — ✅
- Emergency fund: ₹2,40,000 (6 months) — ✅
- DTI: 0% (no debt) — ✅
- Insurance: Health + Term life — ✅
- Investments: ₹15,000/month in SIPs — ✅
- **Score: 5/5 — Excellent Financial Health**

Same salary. Same age. Completely different financial futures. In 10 years, Vikram will still be living paycheck to paycheck. Deepa will have a corpus of ₹35-40 lakhs and complete financial security.
