title: "Debt Management: Good Debt vs Bad Debt"
topic: "personal-finance"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "7 min"
order: 4
prerequisites:
  - "emergency-funds"
keyTakeaways:
  - "Not all debt is evil — an education loan at 8% that increases your earning power by ₹5L/year is GOOD debt. A personal loan at 16% for a vacation is BAD debt."
  - "If your debt's interest rate is higher than what your investments can earn (12-14%), paying off that debt IS your best investment."
  - "Credit card debt at 36-42% is a financial emergency — treat it with the same urgency as a medical crisis."
quiz:
  - question: "Which of these debts should you pay off FIRST?"
    options:
      - "Home loan at 8.5% — ₹15,000 EMI"
      - "Education loan at 9% — ₹8,000 EMI"
      - "Credit card balance — ₹45,000 at 42% APR"
      - "Car loan at 11% — ₹12,000 EMI"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Always pay the highest interest rate first. Credit card at 42% is an emergency — you're paying ₹1,575/month in interest alone on ₹45,000. That's nearly ₹19,000/year. Pay this off before even thinking about investments. Home loan and education loan rates are reasonable and have tax benefits."
  - question: "Arjun has ₹2,00,000 saved. He has a personal loan at 14% (₹3,00,000 remaining). Should he invest the ₹2L or prepay the loan?"
    options:
      - "Invest — the stock market gives 12-15% returns"
      - "Prepay the loan — guaranteed 14% savings"
      - "Keep in FD for safety"
      - "Split 50/50 between loan and investments"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Prepaying the loan gives you a guaranteed 14% return (the interest you save). Stock market returns are NOT guaranteed — they average 12-14% but can be negative in any given year. A guaranteed 14% beats an uncertain 12-14% every time. Prepay higher-interest debt first, always."
  - question: "Which of these is an example of 'good debt'?"
    options:
      - "Personal loan for a destination wedding"
      - "Credit card EMI for the latest iPhone"
      - "Education loan for an MBA from IIM"
      - "Buy-now-pay-later for designer clothes"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "Good debt INCREASES your future earning ability or builds an appreciating asset. An IIM MBA (even at ₹25L cost) can increase your salary from ₹8L to ₹25L+ — the return far exceeds the loan cost. A wedding, phone, and clothes are consumption — they don't make you money."

"Debt is bad." You've heard this your whole life. Your parents probably told you to never borrow money. Many Indian families treat debt like a moral failure.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **that advice is wrong.** Some debt makes you richer. Some debt makes you poorer. And knowing the difference is one of the most important financial skills you'll ever learn.

<Analogy>
  Debt is like fire. In a kitchen, fire cooks your food and keeps you alive. In
  your bedroom, fire burns your house down. The fire itself isn't good or bad —
  it's WHERE and HOW you use it. Same with debt. An education loan "cooks" your
  career. Credit card debt "burns" your finances.
</Analogy>

## The Two Types of Debt

<KeyConcept title="The Simple Test">
  Ask yourself: **"Will this debt make me more money than it costs me?"** If an
  education loan at 9% helps you earn ₹5L more per year — that's a spectacular
  return. If a personal loan at 16% funds a Goa trip — that trip is costing you
  far more than the price on the booking app.
</KeyConcept>

## The Debt Danger Scale

Not all debt costs the same. Here's the real cost of different types:

<IndianContext>
  India has a growing credit card debt problem. As of 2024, Indians owe over
  **₹2.6 lakh crore** in credit card debt. The average credit card interest rate
  is **36-42% APR** — the highest of any common debt product. Meanwhile, many of
  these cardholders are also trying to invest in mutual funds earning 12%.
  That's like trying to fill a bucket with a hole in the bottom.
</IndianContext>

## The Debt Payoff Order (The "Avalanche" Method)

If you have multiple debts, here's the mathematically optimal payoff order:

1. **Credit card debt** (36-42%) — this is a CODE RED emergency
2. **Personal loans** (14-18%) — pay aggressively
3. **Car loan** (9-12%) — regular EMIs are fine
4. **Education loan** (8-10%) — keep paying EMIs, invest alongside
5. **Home loan** (7-9%) — lowest priority, has tax benefits

<CaseStudy title="Meera's Debt Wake-Up Call">
  **Meera**, 27, an architect in Mumbai earning ₹55,000/month, had accumulated:

- Credit card balance: ₹80,000 at 40% APR (min payment ₹4,000/month — mostly interest)
- Personal loan: ₹2,00,000 at 15% (EMI ₹9,400/month)
- Education loan: ₹4,00,000 at 8.5% (EMI ₹8,200/month)

She was also investing ₹5,000/month in mutual funds. Sounds responsible? Let's do the math:

- Mutual fund expected return: **12%**
- Credit card interest she's paying: **40%**
- Net result: She's **losing 28% per year** on every rupee she invests while carrying credit card debt

**What she should have done:** Stop the ₹5,000 SIP temporarily, add it to credit card payments. Clear the ₹80,000 credit card in 6-7 months. Then attack the personal loan. Then restart SIPs — now without the 40% anchor dragging her down.

**Cost of the mistake:** By keeping the credit card debt for an extra year while investing, Meera lost approximately ₹22,000 in net interest.

</CaseStudy>

<KeyConcept title="The Math is Simple">
  If you're paying 15%+ interest on any debt while investing for 12% returns,
  **your investments are going backwards**. Pay off high-interest debt first.
  It's the guaranteed, risk-free "investment" with the highest return available
  to you.
</KeyConcept>

<InteractiveScenario
