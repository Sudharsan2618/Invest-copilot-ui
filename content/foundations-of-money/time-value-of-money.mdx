title: "Time Value of Money: ₹100 Today vs Tomorrow"
topic: "foundations-of-money"
difficulty: "beginner"
readTime: "10 min"
order: 5
prerequisites:
  - "what-is-money"
  - "inflation-silent-wealth-killer"
keyTakeaways:
  - "A rupee today is mathematically worth more than a rupee tomorrow — this is a LAW of finance, not an opinion"
  - "Every day you delay investing is a day of compounding you can never get back — delay is the most expensive cost in finance"
  - "Use TVM to make smart decisions: compare future payoffs to today's value, negotiate better salaries, and plan for retirement"
quiz:
  - question: "Your company offers ₹5,00,000 bonus today OR ₹6,50,000 bonus in 2 years. If you can earn 12% on your investments, which is worth more?"
    options:
      - "₹6.5L in 2 years — it's more money"
      - "₹5L today — invested at 12% it becomes ₹6.27L in 2 years, but that's less than ₹6.5L so wait"
      - "₹5L today — when you account for risk and inflation, the bird in hand is usually better"
      - "They're exactly the same"
    correct: 0
    explanation: "₹5L × (1.12)^2 = ₹6.27L. ₹6.5L > ₹6.27L, so mathematically waiting IS better. BUT — this assumes the company keeps its promise, you stay employed, and no emergencies arise. In practice, the ₹5L today might still be preferable because of the certainty premium and reinvestment flexibility."
  - question: "Why is the concept of 'opportunity cost' directly connected to TVM?"
    options:
      - "They're not connected"
      - "Because every rupee has alternative uses — spending ₹500 on dinner means losing what ₹500 could have become if invested"
      - "Because opportunities only come once"
      - "Because banks charge fees"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "TVM means money can grow over time. So spending ₹500 today doesn't cost you ₹500 — it costs you the FUTURE value of that ₹500. At 12% for 20 years, that dinner costs you ₹4,824 in future value. Understanding this changes every spending decision."
  - question: "You need ₹50 lakh for your child's education in 15 years. How much must you invest monthly in a fund returning 12% to reach this goal?"
    options:
      - "₹27,778/month (simply dividing ₹50L by 180 months)"
      - "₹10,000/month — compounding does the rest"
      - "₹10,030/month — the precise SIP needed, which is 64% less than the naive calculation"
      - "₹40,000/month — you can't take risks with education money"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "A SIP calculator shows ₹10,030/month at 12% for 15 years gives ~₹50L. Without TVM knowledge, you'd think you need ₹27,778/month (flat division). TVM saved you ₹17,748/month — that's ₹2.13L per year freed up for other goals or living expenses."

## The Most Powerful Concept in All of Finance

If you only learn ONE concept from this entire course, let it be this one. The <JargonTooltip term="Time Value of Money" definition="The principle that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future, because money can earn returns over time.">Time Value of Money</JargonTooltip> (TVM) is the foundation of every financial decision ever made — from buying a house to negotiating your salary to planning retirement.

It sounds academic, but it's intensely practical. Once you understand TVM, you'll see the world differently. Every purchase, every paycheck, every financial decision has a hidden time dimension that most people ignore.

<Analogy>
Think of money like a mango seed. A seed you plant today can grow into a tree that produces hundreds of mangoes over 20 years. A seed you receive 5 years from now? It's the same seed — but it missed 5 years of growing. It'll produce fewer mangoes in total.

Now here's the twist: in finance, **every single rupee is a seed.** A ₹500 rupee note is a seed that can be planted (invested). The question is: are you planting your seeds or hoarding them in a drawer?

</Analogy>

## Why ₹1 Today ≠ ₹1 Tomorrow

Three forces make today's money more valuable than tomorrow's money:

<ComparisonTable
  title="The Three Reasons Money Has Time Value"
  headers={["Force", "How It Works", "Real Impact"]}
  rows={[
    [
      "Earning Potential",
      "Money invested today earns returns",
      "₹100 at 12% becomes ₹112 in one year. The ₹100 you get next year can't earn that year's return",
    ],
    [
      "Inflation Erosion",
      "Prices rise, so future rupees buy less",
      "₹100 next year buys only ₹93-95 worth of stuff at 5-7% inflation",
    ],
    [
      "Uncertainty Premium",
      "The future is never guaranteed",
      "A promised ₹100 next year might not materialize — job loss, company closure, policy changes",
    ],
  ]}
/>

<KeyConcept title="The True Cost of Waiting">
Every day your money sits uninvested is a day it could have been growing. This isn't philosophical — it's arithmetic.

**₹1,00,000 invested today at 12% for 30 years = ₹29,96,000**
**₹1,00,000 invested 5 years late at 12% for 25 years = ₹17,00,000**

Five years of delay cost you **₹12,96,000** — on just ₹1 lakh. Your procrastination literally costs more than the original amount. This is why financial advisors say: **"The best time to invest was yesterday. The second best time is today."**

## The Two Faces of TVM: Future Value & Present Value

      "Future Value (FV)",

    [
      "Present Value (PV)",
      "If I need ₹X in Y years, how much do I need to invest today?",

## TVM Applied to Real Indian Decisions

<IndianContext>
**TVM is why SIPs work so well in India:**

The average Indian worker has 30-35 years of earning life (age 25 to 58). Here's what ₹5,000/month SIP looks like at 12%:

- **Started at 25, invested till 55:** Corpus = ₹1.76 crore (total invested: ₹18L)
- **Started at 30, invested till 55:** Corpus = ₹94.9 lakh (total invested: ₹15L)
- **Started at 35, invested till 55:** Corpus = ₹49.4 lakh (total invested: ₹12L)

Starting at 25 vs 35 = **₹1.27 crore extra** on just ₹6L more invested. The earlier money had 10 more years of compounding — that's 10 years of "free growth" that can never be recovered.

## TVM in Everyday Decisions

TVM isn't just for investment planning. It should influence every financial decision you make:

    ],
    [
      "Salary negotiation",
      "They offered ₹12 LPA, good enough",
      "Each ₹1L/year extra = ₹8,333/month. Invested for 20 years = ₹1 crore. Fight for every lakh.",
    ],
    [
      "Weekend trip (₹15K)",
      "I deserve a break",
      "₹15K/month saved instead, invested for 25 years = ₹ 2.84 crore. Skip 2-3 trips/year, invest the rest",
    ],
    [
      "Taking a 5% raise vs. 10% at new company",
      "Leaving is scary",
      "On ₹10 LPA, the 5% difference = ₹50K/year. Over 10 years invested = ₹8.8L opportunity cost of staying",
    ],
    [
      "Prepaying home loan vs. investing",
      "Being debt-free feels better",
      "If loan is 8.5% and you can earn 12% investing, the math favors investing (but psychology matters too)",

  options={[
    {
      text: "Option A: ₹5L now — bird in hand!",
      feedback:

## The Opportunity Cost of Delay: A Visual

<ComparisonChart
  title="Cost of Delaying a ₹10,000/month SIP by Just 5 Years (at 12%)"
  items={[
    {
      label: "Start at age 25 (invest 30 yrs)",
      value: 35209787,

    },
    { label: "Gap = ₹1.62 crore", value: 16232898, color: "destructive" },
  ]}
/>

That gap — **₹1.62 crore** — is the price of procrastination on a modest ₹10,000/month SIP. Every year you delay costs you roughly ₹20-30 lakh in future wealth.
